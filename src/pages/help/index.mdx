## Search

### Basic

Search for a **[toki pona word](https://linku.la/)** such as [pona](/?query=pona). If it was used at least 40 times in my data, you'll get a graph! **Absolute** shows the total number of times that word appeared over time, and **Relative** shows the percentage of times that word appeared among all words in the same time period.

You can search for up to **6 words** in one phrase, such as `mi kama sona e toki pona`. Note that relative mode changes slightly for phrases: it will show the percentage of times that word appeared among **all same-length phrases** in the same time period.

You can graph multiple searches at once by separating them with commas, even mixing words and phrases: `toki, pona, toki pona`

Lastly, you can limit the search to sentences with more than a certain number of words, up to 6. This is handy when the word you want to study is more frequent in short sentences than long ones, or if you're specifically interested in studying words as they occur in longer-than-average sentences.

#### Comparing two phrases over time

`sina seme, sina pali e seme`

#### Reoccurring events

`suno pi toki pona`

#### Major Events

`pu, ku, su`

#### Comparing Modifiers

`wawa a, wawa mute, wawa suli, wawa sewi`

### Advanced

You can **add** two or more search terms with `+`, such as in `ale + ali`. This will give you a single line with the occurrences or percentage of occurrences of both words.

You can also **subtract** with `-`, as in `tenpo ni - tenpo ni la`. This will give you a single line with the occurrences of the second word removed from the first. This is good for knowing how often a word or phrase occurs with some specific larger phrase excluded, or for seeing exactly how much more popular one word is than another.

Lastly, you can **override the currently selected sentence length** by appending an `_` with some number from 1 to 6 to the end of the word or phrase. This is handy for searches such as `toki_1 - toki_2`, which tell you the number of times "toki" appears on its own. Note: If an override would search for the current sentence length, the underscore is ignored.

#### Multiple representations of one word

`ale + ali`

#### Isolating a word or phrase

`toki_1 - toki_2` - every use of toki that isn't in a sentence of 2 or more words

#### Disambiguating two uses

`toki - toki pona` - every use of toki that isn't in "toki pona"

`san - kekan san` - every use of san that isn't in "kekan san"

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is "smoothing?"

This is a feature I ~~stole~~ borrowed from Google Ngrams! If your smoothing is 1, each data point is averaged with its prior and following neighbors. If your smoothing is 10, each point is averaged with the 10 neighbors before and after. This makes noisy data easier to read, at the cost of being a little less reflective of reality.

### Why didn't the graph change?

If you search for a word with no data, I don't update the graph.

Uh, I don't have any error handling yet! If you search for a word with no data, I just don't do anything. You probably searched for a word that doesn't have any data.

### Why is the graph empty?

This is also an error handling issue, but a different one. You made a search with a malformed term and I didn't catch and throw it out. Oops.

### Why is my subtraction negative?

That's allowed! If you do `tawa pona - kama pona`, you get a graph with a significant negative portion because "kama pona" is a more common phrase than "tawa pona."

That said, if you're doing a search like `tenpo ni - tenpo ni la - lon tenpo ni`, you have tiny negative portions of the relative graph even though there are none in absolute. Oops, floating point imprecision. I would need to do all my adding and subtracting before converting to relative numbers, but I can't do that if you're mixing phrase lengths- the relative occurrences of phrases aren't measured against the same totals as the relative occurrences of words.

### Why is the data so noisy before 2020?

There is much less data from before 2020.

When everyone was trapped indoors for some two years during the COVID-19 pandemic, Toki Pona saw a huge spike in popularity. You can see the climb in activity in every word when in absolute mode. This also affects the relative graph though- before 2020, each word written is a much larger portion of all the words for that time period! To help, you can add smoothing to relative mode, which will average out

### Why is there a huge spike on [date] for [word]?

This data isn't from "professional" sources, unlike Google Ngrams which is sourced entirely from published books. In "professional" sources, you wouldn't expect an editor to let a paragraph like "woo yeah! woo yeah! woo yeah! woo yeah! woo yeah! woo yeah!" remain in the final product. But in Discord and any other social media platform, there is no editorial oversight- silly goofy abounds. This affects mu, wan, tu, luka, mute, ale, and probably others, which you can see [here](/?query=mu%2C+wan%2C+tu%2C+luka%2C+mute%2C+ale&minSentLen=1&scale=absolute&smoothing=0)
).
