This tutorial takes you step-by-step through using ilo Muni, exploring its features, explaining its graphs, and providing example searches. If a toki pona phrase is a link, it will take you to the graph to show you that search result.

## Table of Contents

## Search

### Words

Search for a **[toki pona word](https://linku.la/)** such as [**pona**](/ilo-muni/?query=pona). If it appeared at least 40 times across all the places and times I checked, you'll get a graph showing how that word has been used over time! By default, you'll see what percentage of all words were the searched word.

<details>
  <summary>**Examples**</summary>

- See the growth of words coined only a few years ago like [**tonsi**](/ilo-muni/?query=tonsi) or [**misikeke**](/ilo-muni/?query=misikeke)
- Explore the use of rarer words like [**majuna**](/ilo-muni/?query=majuna), [**linluwi**](/ilo-muni/?query=linluwi), or [**kiki**](/ilo-muni/?query=kiki)
- Look for proper names like [**Sonko**](/ilo-muni/?query=sonko) or [**Inli**](/ilo-muni/?query=inli)

</details>

### Phrases

You can search for **up to 6 words** in one phrase, such as [**mi kama sona e toki pona**](/ilo-muni/?query=mi+kama+sona+e+toki+pona). Note that the more words are in a phrase, the fewer times it is likely to appear- so don't be surprised if you don't get a result. Try searching for shorter phrases, like [**kama pona**](/ilo-muni/?query=kama+pona) or [**anu seme**](/ilo-muni/?query=anu+seme).

<details>
  <summary>**Examples**</summary>

- Examine the use of grammatical features like [**kepeken e**](/ilo-muni/?query=kepeken+e)
- Watch phrases come and go over time as the things they reference do, like [**tenpo pana**](/ilo-muni/?query=tenpo+pana&smoothing=0), [**tenpo monsuta**](/ilo-muni/?query=tenpo+monsuta&smoothing=0), or [**suno pi toki pona**](/ilo-muni/?query=suno+pi+toki+pona&smoothing=0)

</details>

### Multiple Searches

You can graph **multiple terms at once** by separating them with commas, even mixing words and phrases: [**toki, pona, toki pona**](/ilo-muni?query=toki,+pona,+toki+pona). Often, different terms will have very different graphs, resulting in it being hard to read more than the top one or two graphs.

<details>
  <summary>**Examples**</summary>

- Compare former synonyms like [**lukin, oko**](/ilo-muni/?query=lukin,+oko)
- See the close relationship between similar words like [**pan, kili**](/ilo-muni/?query=pan,+kili) or [**laso, loje, jelo, walo, pimeja**](/ilo-muni/?query=laso,+loje,+jelo,+walo,+pimeja)
- Compare the modifiers that appear after specific words, like [**wawa a, wawa mute, wawa lili, wawa suli, wawa sewi**](/ilo-muni/?query=wawa+a,+wawa+mute,+wawa+lili,+wawa+suli,+wawa+sewi)
- Examine how poeple talk about their skill in Toki Pona with [**sona toki pona, sona e toki pona, sona pi toki pona**](/ilo-muni/?query=sona+toki+pona,+sona+e+toki+pona,+sona+pi+toki+pona)
- Compare greetings over time, like [**sina seme, sina pali e seme**](/ilo-muni/?query=sina+seme,+sina+pali+e+seme)
- See how popular Sonja's books are with [**pu, ku, su**](/ilo-muni/?query=pu,+ku,+su)

</details>

### Adding phrases

You can **add two or more phrases together** by putting a `+` between them. This is helpful for combining similar words or even synonyms, like [**ale + ali**](/ilo-muni/?query=ale+%2B+ali). You can also use it to compare multiple related words to another one, like [**pan + kili, moku**](/ilo-muni/?query=pan+%2B+kili,+moku).

It often helps to graph some or all of the summed phrases with the independent phrases so you can see how much the graph has shifted, such as in [**pan + kili, moku, pan, kili**](/ilo-muni/?query=pan+%2B+kili,+moku,+pan,+kili)

<details>
  <summary>**Examples**</summary>

- See what portion of Toki Pona is pure particles: [**li, e, la, pi, o, en, anu**](/ilo-muni/?query=li+%2B+e+%2B+la+%2B+pi+%2B+o+%2B+en+%2B+anu)
- Combine multiple ways to write the same word, like [**ala + x**](/ilo-muni/?query=ala+%2B+x) or [**anu + y, anu, y**](/ilo-muni/?query=anu+%2B+y,+anu,+y)
- Do that with UCSUR text specifically: [**toki + 󱥬**](/ilo-muni/?query=toki+%2B+󱥬)
- Combine related words to compare to others: [**a + n, pona**](/ilo-muni/?query=a+%2B+n,+pona)

</details>

### Subtracting phrases

You can **subtract one or more phrases from another** by putting a `-` between them. This is helpful when you'd like to omit a specific use of a word, such as in [**toki - toki pona**](/ilo-muni/?query=toki+-+toki+pona). This gives you all the uses of the word "toki" which are not in the phrase "toki pona".

<details>
  <summary>**Examples**</summary>

- Determine what grammatical positions a phrase is most common in: [**tenpo ni - tenpo ni la - lon tenpo ni, tenpo ni**](/ilo-muni/?query=tenpo+ni+-+tenpo+ni+la+-+lon+tenpo+ni,+tenpo+ni)
- Examine the use of a word without other conflicting terms, like in [**san - kekan san**](/ilo-muni/?query=san+-+kekan+san)

</details>

### Override Minimum Sentence Length

You can **set a minimum sentence length** for one term by adding an underscore `_` and a number from 1 to 6 **to the end of that term**. For example, [**toki_1, toki_6**](/ilo-muni/?query=toki_1,+toki_6) will show you the percentage of times toki appeared in any sentence, versus how often it appeared in sentences with at least 6 words. You can also do this with phrases in the same way: [**ona li, ona li_6**](/ilo-muni/?query=ona+li,+ona+li_6)

You can use this with subtraction to isolate a word or phrase: The search [**toki - toki_2**](/ilo-muni/?query=toki+-+toki_2) will show you every time "toki" appeared, minus the times it appeared in sentences with 2 or more words- which means you have all the times "toki" was the only word in the sentence. Or, put another way, all the times toki meant "hello"! (except for the times it was an answer to a question, of course!)

Read ahead to [the options section on Minimum Sentence Length](#minimum-sentence-length) for more details!

  <summary>**Examples**</summary>

- Get even more accurate information about greetings: [**sina seme - sina seme_3, sina pali e seme - sina pali e seme_5**](/ilo-muni/?query=sina+seme+-+sina+seme_3,+sina+pali+e+seme+-+sina+pali+e+seme_5)
- See if there is a difference in relative use of words: [**toki, pona, toki_6, pona_6**](/ilo-muni/?query=toki,+pona,+toki_6,+pona_6). (There is!)

## Options

Note: [Scale has its own section](#scale), because it's much more complicated than the other options.

### Minimum Sentence Length

By default, **All sentences** is set, meaning you will see how words or phrases appear in any length of sentence. If you set this option to **3+ words per sentence**, you'll see how words or phrases appear in sentences which have at least 3 words. This can be helpful if you want to study more "substantial" uses of words, i.e. those that appear in longer sentences.

Be aware that phrases have a minimum sentence length equal to how many words are in them. That is, "toki pona" can only appear in sentences with at least two words- which I hope makes sense! Because of this, the minimum sentence length is always implicitly set to at least the length of the phrase.

Also be aware that when graphing on any **relative scale**, the percentage is derived by dividing the number of occurrences for the search term by the total number of words in the same time period.

If you're curious why this is done instead of dividing by the number of words in sentences of the appropriate minimum length, here's a simplified example of how that works, and why I do this:

<details>
<summary>**Demonstration**</summary>

Imagine the following scenario:

- There 10,000 words
- 9,000 of those words are in sentences with at least 2 words
- 100 of the words are **toki**
- 90 of those **toki** are in sentences with at least 2 words

With this data, asking "What percentage of words are toki?" means we get 1% (100 / 10,000), which makes sense, and this is the only reasonable question to measure toki on its own.

However, there are two ways to measure toki in sentences with at least 2 words (**toki_2**): You could measure it as a portion of all words, or as a portion of words from sentences with at least 2 words. These two different choices have different results: **toki_2** is **0.9%** (90 / 10,000) of all words, but **1%** (90 / 9,000) of the words in sentences with at least 2 words.

We can use this information to determine which answer is best for this graphing tool by exploring what happens when you search **toki - toki_2**.

In the sample data, graphing **toki - toki_2** with toki_2 measured as a portion of all words means we get **0.1%**: ((100 - 90) / 10,000). That is, toki appears exactly 10 times on its own in this data. Graphing instead with **toki_2** measured as a portion of words in sentences with 2 or more words means we get **0%**: ((100 / 10,000) - (90 / 9,000)). In other words, we get a misleading outcome because we're subtracting two incomparable percentages.

There is value in knowing what portion of sentences with at least 2 words are some specific word. This graphing tool does not offer that information because doing so would produce misleading graphs for both side-by-side comparison and for adding or subtracting specific results. If you're interested in that alternate data, [download the database!](TODO)

### Smoothing

By default, **2 smoothing** is set. The number is how many neighbors **on both sides** of a given data point will be averaged with that point. For example, if you set **5 smoothing**, it means a given point will be set to the average of the 5 points before, 5 points after, and itself.

Smoothing is helpful for making noisy graphs more readable while preserving the trend line of the original graph. Compare the graphs of **wawa, nasa, suwi, sewi, suli** with [**0 smoothing**](/ilo-muni/?query=wawa%2C+nasa%2C+suwi%2C+sewi%2C+suli&smoothing=0) and [**5 smoothing**](/ilo-muni/?query=wawa%2C+nasa%2C+suwi%2C+sewi%2C+suli&smoothing=5).

Note that smoothing can produce misleading graphs with respect to the time axis, such as [**implying that misikeke was used before November 2019**](/ilo-muni/?query=misikeke&smoothing=10) or [**smearing periodic phrases over too much time**](/ilo-muni/?query=tenpo+pana&smoothing=10). Sometimes, **0 smoothing** is better!

Some [scales](#scale) will have smoothing disabled, usually because it wouldn't make sense to average their values. This applies to the **absolute** scale, for example, because it is meant to show you the exact number of times a given word or phrase appeared! This also applies to both offered **derivatives**, because they are completely impervious to this method of averaging.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is **smoothing?**

This is a feature I ~~stole~~ borrowed from Google Ngrams! If your smoothing is 1, each data point is averaged with its prior and following neighbors. If your smoothing is 10, each point is averaged with the 10 neighbors before and after. This makes noisy data easier to read, at the cost of being a little less reflective of reality.

### Why didn't the graph change?

If you search for a word with no data, I don't update the graph.

Uh, I don't have any error handling yet! If you search for a word with no data, I just don't do anything. You probably searched for a word that doesn't have any data.

### Why is the graph empty?

This is also an error handling issue, but a different one. You made a search with a malformed term and I didn't catch and throw it out. Oops.

### Why is my subtraction negative?

That's allowed! If you do [**tawa pona - kama pona**](ilo-muni/?query=tawa+pona+-+kama+pona), you'll get a graph which is mostly negative. This means the phrase "kama pona" is more common than the phrase "tawa pona", probably because the community is very welcoming!

It's _probably_ possible to get floating point silliness when subtracting, but I haven't seen that happen personally- [please reach out if you spot it!](https://github.com/gregdan3/ilo-muni/issues)

### Why is the data so noisy before 2020?

In short, there is much less data to examine from before 2020. [if you download the database](TODO), the data I track goes back to 2010, but I limit queries to August 2015 and later in the frontend, so the graphs aren't as messy.

So the next question is, why 2020? Although I probably don't need to answer that, I'll go ahead and do so:

When everyone was trapped indoors for some two years during the COVID-19 pandemic, Toki Pona saw a huge spike in popularity. You can see the climb in activity in every word when the scale is set to "absolute". This also affects the relative graph though- before 2020, each word written is a much larger portion of all the words for that time period! To help, you can add smoothing to relative mode, which will average out

### Why is there a huge spike on [date] for [word]?

This data isn't from **professional** sources, unlike Google Ngrams which is sourced entirely from published books. In **professional** sources, you wouldn't expect an editor to let a paragraph like **woo yeah! woo yeah! woo yeah! woo yeah! woo yeah! woo yeah!** remain in the final product. But in Discord and any other social media platform, there is no editorial oversight- silly goofy abounds. This affects mu, wan, tu, luka, mute, ale, and probably others, which you can see [here](/?query=mu,+wan,+tu,+luka,+mute,+ale&minSentLen=1&scale=absolute&smoothing=0)
).
