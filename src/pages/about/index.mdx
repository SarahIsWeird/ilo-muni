This page is about **how and why ilo Muni exists**, plus future plans, how to
contribute, and thanks for everyone who helped me along the way. If you want to
know how to use ilo Muni, [check the help page!](/ilo-muni/help/)

Feel free to skip around. If you don't care about a section, that's totally
okay!

## Why did you make ilo Muni?

Back in January 2024, several members of the toki pona community came together
with the same idea all at once: We should write a proposal to get
[sitelen pona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sitelen_Pona) included in
[Unicode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode)! From there, it turned out that
[jan Lepeka](https://github.com/RebeccaRGB) had experience writing proposals for
Unicode and had already written a massive portion of a sitelen pona proposal.
Many others signed on to help, so we all got to work right away.

~~This has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad
move~~ This turned out to be challenging for many reasons beyond the
documentation of how toki pona and sitelen pona are used.

First, many of the members of the workgroup did not agree on what words should
be encoded or why. We examined the
[Linku usage data](https://sona.pona.la/wiki/Usage_categories) to get a
reasonable answer for what words to encode- that took a while and had its own
complexities, but it did work out at the time.

Unfortunately, there was no comparable data for sitelen pona glyphs. While many
were obvious because most words only have one glyph, over a dozen words have
multiple glyphs with different levels of use- especially when the words
themselves are low use. We tried running an ad-hoc survey to study glyph usage,
but this simultaneously revealed how limited our perspective was and how
difficult it would be to answer our original question.

While examining the survey data, we found we had failed to offer at least one
glyph as an option, resulting in a large number of write-ins for a version of
"olin" where the hearts overlap rather than stack. Then we observed that the
results for some glyphs were _far_ higher than expected or anecdotally observed,
particularly a variant of "linluwi" where the three circles of "kulupu" are
connected with lines.

This, coupled with a later survey about whether certain glyphs are "distinct",
led us down a brand new rabbit hole: A large number of survey respondents seemed
to answer how they would _like_ to use toki pona, or how they think they will
use it in the future, rather than how they do so now. Several members of the
workgroup, including myself, could not reconcile the reported usage from the
surveys with our observations.

By March, we hadn't come to any agreement about what glyphs to use for some
words, and the prior agreement about what words to encode in the first place had
fallen apart _because_ of the observed issues with the two glyph surveys. At
that point, we chose to pivot: What if we directly studied usage?

We submitted a preliminary proposal with the only set of words we could all
agree _must_ be in the proposal, that being the
[nimi pu](https://sona.pona.la/wiki/nimi_pu) plus
[tonsi](https://sona.pona.la/wiki/tonsi). It has not been added to the
[Unicode document register](https://www.unicode.org/L2/L-curdoc.htm) as of
writing, but Unicode has acknowledged it!

After this, the new work to be done was much more open-ended. I started
improving upon my Discord bot,
[ilo pi toki pona taso](https://github.com/gregdan3/ilo-pi-toki-pona-taso). At
the time, it had a simple way to detect whether or not you were speaking toki
pona, so that it could remind you to speak toki pona if you didn't. But when I
say simple, I do mean simple- it could be evaded by capitalizing the first word
of every sentence, or carefully dodged by using only the 14 letters in Toki
Pona's alphabet, or ignored entirely by quoting your text. This wouldn't do,
since my goal was to fetch all the data I could from as many communities as I
could and examine only the messages that are "in toki pona."

From there, I created a parsing library called
[sona toki](https://github.com/gregdan3/sona-toki), a script called
[sona mute](https://github.com/gregdan3/sona-mute) for counting all the words in
toki pona sentences and stuffing it into a database, and this tool,
[ilo Muni](https://github.com/gregdan3/ilo-muni). The work you're reading now
has been five months in the making!

## Where is the data from?

Anywhere toki pona is written in text, so long as there is a date associated
with every message and the community itself is open to the public. Right now, I
support three platforms:

### Discord

Discord makes up the majority of all written toki pona. For that matter,
[ma pona pi toki pona](https://discord.gg/mapona) makes up the majority of all
written toki pona on its own. As such, this data is the most important to have a
look at- but unfortunately, it is also among the more locked-down platforms on
this list. Discord does not offer any native functionality to export messages,
but [this excellent project](https://github.com/Tyrrrz/DiscordChatExporter)
enables you to fetch all messages you have access to in any server you're in.

### Telegram

Conveniently, Telegram offers an "export chat" function directly in its desktop
UI, and this dumps every message in the chat that you can see from the start of
the chat's existence forward. I found all the communities I could by Telegram's
search function and asking around in other communities,
[then collected them here after I was done](https://sona.pona.la/wiki/Communities#Telegram).

After that, jan Pensa (@spencjo) helped me out by exporting two particular chats
for me:

- **mi tok e toki pona**: a workgroup attemping to get toki pona an ISO-639
  code. This chat is functionally archived since they succeeded-
  [toki pona has had an ISO code for over two years!](https://iso639-3.sil.org/code/tok)
- **kulupu pi toki pona**: This chat is public, but up until April 2017 it was
  configured to only show messages since you joined. Fortunately, jan Pensa had
  been in this group since March 2016!

The format for Telegram messages is a bit odd in their official exports, and I
can't tell what users are bots from the exports alone- but other than that,
Telegram was refreshingly easy to add to this list.

### Reddit

Reddit moved its API behind a pay-wall long before I began this project, so it
is no longer reasonable to "officially" scrape Reddit. They also limited
scrollback on all endpoints in the user API to only 1000 items, meaning
unofficial scraping would have to be done live in order to be sure you fetched
everything. I obviously wasn't doing my own live scraping of Reddit, but thanks
to
[the incredible work of Pushshift, /u/raiderbdev, and /u/Watchful1](https://www.reddit.com/r/pushshift/comments/1akrhg3/separate_dump_files_for_the_top_40k_subreddits/),
I was able to fetch at least [/r/tokipona](https://reddit.com/r/tokipona)
through the end of 2023.

On that note: If you have or can create a complete archive of
[/r/mi_lon](https://reddit.com/r/mi_lon),
[/r/tokiponataso](https://reddit.com/r/tokiponataso),
[/r/tokiponaunpa](https://reddit.com/r/tokiponaunpa),
[/r/liputenpo](https://reddit.com/r/liputenpo), or any other toki pona
communities on Reddit, please
[let me know](https://github.com/gregdan3/ilo-muni)!

## Will you add more communities?

Yes! The main barrier to adding more communities is being able to download data
from the given platform. For Discord, there is already an excellent open source
archiving tool. For Telegram, you can export entire chats in the desktop client.
And for Reddit, Pushshift previously archived everything they could find- and
this work was picked up by /u/raiderbdev after they shut down.

For everything else, I'd love to add them, but I need a way to get the data.

### forums.tokipona.org

To an outsider, it may seem odd to want to include a specific singular forum in
this data- but this forum is important because it was active from 1 Oct 2009 to
mid-2020. Most of this period is unrepresented in the current data, and this
space is one of only a handful that were in use during that time. As such, this
forum is highly important to the history of toki pona.

I do already have a backup of this data, but adding it to the database is
difficult. I lack user IDs, post IDs, and properly formatted quotes. That's
because I used
[this backup tool](https://github.com/Dascienz/phpBB-forum-scraper), and
frankly, it's not very good. I have thus far not needed to make my own scrapers
for any of the data I've collected, but this one may be different. If you know
of a better phpBB scraper, or have a cleaner capture of this data,
[please reach out](https://github.com/gregdan3/ilo-muni/issues/new)!

### Yahoo group

From some time in 2002 until Oct 1 2009, the toki pona yahoo group was one of
very few spaces where toki pona was spoken, and it appears to have been the most
popular. The IRC channel could have been more popular, but it wasn't preserved
beyond a handful of specific conversations that I'm aware of. Fortunately, the
entire yahoo group is backed up on the forum above. Unfortunately, its
formatting is mangled badly because its newlines are missing. If that weren't
enough, its formatting is already highly inconsistent due to the unstable nature
of email from provider to provider. Including it in the database as-is would be
messy and uninformative, or even misleading; it needs some pre-processing
effort.

### Facebook

There are several toki pona communities on Facebook,
[here](https://www.facebook.com/groups/sitelen),
[here](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1590434267942176/),
[here](https://www.facebook.com/groups/543153192468898/), and
[here](https://www.facebook.com/groups/2424398856/). The majority of their
activity is in a period similar to that of Discord- that is, from 2020 onward-
but they have much more pre-2020 activity than most other communities that
existed around that time. Unfortunately, scraping data from Facebook is
extremely difficult- the handful of open source scrapers that exist are
variously inconsistent, low quality, or unsupported.

### LiveJournal

There are at least two LiveJournal blogs that focused on toki pona,
[here](https://tokipona.livejournal.com/) and
[here](https://ru-tp.livejournal.com/), which were active in a similar time
period to the forum or yahoo group. They're both small, but anything counts,
especially for the history of toki pona before 2016. Unfortunately, all the
LiveJournal archiving tools I can find are for improving the personal data
export feature, not for scraping the site.

### toki.social (Mastodon)

[toki.social](https://toki.social) is a Mastodon instance for toki pona! It's
been around since early 2022. Not much else to say; it's a lovely place,
although it's fairly quiet.

### kulupu.pona.la

[kulupu.pona.la](https://archive.org/details/kulupu.pona.la) was a forum hosted
by [mazziechai](https://github.com/mazziechai/) which closed abruptly in
November 2023 due to trolling. The forum was archived fully by Mazzie before the
shutdown, but the format is pure HTML, making it a difficult to get the
necessary data out of it.

## Will you update the data over time?

Yes! I plan to update this data at least once per year, but doing so two or
three times isn't out of the question. Collecting, parsing, and counting up all
of the data is not labor intensive- writing the code to do all that was, but
most of that is done.

That said, there isn't much value in updating more than once per year. Google
Ngrams only updates about every three years. Trends in language don't generally
happen in weeks or months- even at the community's current size

## Why "ilo Muni?"

Several reasons! I was originally going to name this project "lipu mute",
"multiplicity document." However, I realized near the end of July that if this
tool had a name, I would be able to search its name in this tool! This was too
cool to pass up.

From there, choosing a name was easy. I wanted to name it in toki pona, and have
the sitelen pona of the name be a phrase which also describes itself. This tool
shows how many words there are, and also the frequency of words, which are
respectively "mute nimi" and "nimi mute". Taking the first syllables of each
word, you get "Muni" and "Nimu."

I ran a poll with both, and the results were very close (with a slight
preference for Muni!), so I decided to search both names in the version of ilo
Muni that existed at that time- "Nimu" had just over 40 results, but "Muni"
didn't come up, so I went with it. Here we are!

## I'm doing research! How do I cite you?

Uh, I don't know yet! Please [email me](mailto:gregdan3+ilomuni@protonmail.com)
and we can talk about it.

## Thank you to...

- **ilo Nija** for the logo! It's a stylized version of the sitelen pona name
  for ilo Muni- the three bars are "mute" and the rectangle is "nimi". It's so
  sick.
- **jan Lepeka, jan Juwan, akesi Jan, jan Tepo, ijo Alison, and many others of
  the Unicode proposal workgroup** for convicing me to start on this project.
  It's been incredibly rewarding, and I hope it helps ~~and doesn't cause lots
  of future arguments~~.
- **jan Telesi** and **ilo Tani** for a bit of technical direction along the
  way!
- waso Keli for
- **kala Asi** for listening and helping me iterate on the early versions of the
  graph and search tool.
- **kala Asi, jan Asiku, ilo Tani, pan Pake, and waso Ete** for helping me work
  through the set theory reasoning necessary to display the data "correctly!"
- [**phiresky**](https://github.com/phiresky/sql.js-httpvfs) for the _excellent_
  `sql.js-httpvfs` library, without which this project would have taken _much_
  longer and been much more stressful.
- [**jordemort**](https://jordemort.dev/blog/client-side-search/) for figuring
  out how to use that library in Astro!
